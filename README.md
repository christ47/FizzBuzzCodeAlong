# FizzBuzzCodeAlong
The FizzBuzzCodeAlong was created during a Code Along project with Sparta Global's Engineering 20 Stream. Methods were implemented with the aim to pass or fail following the Test Driving Development process. Finally, the code was then refactored to reduce complexities.

This app contains three mini-projects. It was imperative to ensure the codes were testable to enable testing through RSpec. Methods and test are located in the library(lib) and spec respectively. In FizzBuzz, numbers were printed from one to one hundred. If the number was divisible by three, five or both instead Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz will be printed.  

Fibonacci and Multiples are the first two challenges in Project Euler. The Fibonacci challenge requires code to calculate the sum of even Fibonacci numbers below four million. Multiples required code capable of calculating the sum of numbers below 1000 that are divisible by three or five.  Descriptions of these project can be found at:https://projecteuler.net/archives
