# FizzBuzzCodeAlong
This app is the code along for the SDET TDD rspec lab. Rspec was utilised to run test on a prewritten file. The TTD process was used to make each method fail then pass. The code is then refactored to reduce complexities. This project is based on a previous app when I completed this lab individually. Differently, this lab was completed with Sparta Global Engineering 20 to share logic and solutions.

The first two challenges in Project Euler were completed. Descriptions of the project can be found at:https://projecteuler.net/archives
